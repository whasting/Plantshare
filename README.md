# Plantshare

[Live][demo]

[demo]:https://colinritchey.github.io/PlantShareDemo/

PlantShare is a mobile plant/produce distribution app that allows users
to post and request plants from local users. The dashboard keeps track of
current listings, a user's own listings and their requests. Owners of the
plant can approve or deny requests.

## Technologies & Technical Challenges

Plantshare will be using Rails on the backend and React Native on the frontend.

(Coming Soon) Additionally, the site will be using a combination of Google Maps Api to display the location of a plant detail item and Cloudinary image storage Api to allow users to upload images of their plants.
